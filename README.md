# Toroidal Fractal Intelligence (ATOM)

A novel AI architecture based on continuous structured learning through toroidal fractal dynamics.

## Vision

Build an AI architecture that doesn't fundamentally rely on the paradigm:

```
neurons → layers → weight matrices → massive backpropagation → fixed training
```

Instead, ATOM develops **dynamic computational matter** capable of continuously transforming tokens into internal structures, then evolving these structures through interaction, aggregation, abstraction, and consolidation.

## Core Principle

The system is based on continuous transformation:

```
TOKEN + CONTEXT + STATE → TOROIDAL STRUCTURE
```

The token is not simply transformed into activation and propagated through successive layers. It is converted into **computational matter**.

This matter can then:
- Interact
- Superpose
- Aggregate
- Form structures
- Produce abstractions
- Be consolidated
- Be reused
- Contribute to output production

## Key Features

- **Infinite Learning**: No boundary between training and inference
- **Continuous Thought**: Internal reasoning before generation
- **Structural Emergence**: Atoms → Aggregates → Abstractions
- **Selective Consolidation**: Only stable structures are persistent
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Shared rules control many structures
- **GPU/CPU Flexible**: Can run on modest hardware

## Research Questions

1. **Structural Efficiency**: Can we get more capacity per parameter through structure composition?
2. **Infinite Learning**: Can the system learn continuously without forgetting?
3. **Computational Economy**: Can shared rules control many structures efficiently?
4. **Abstraction Reuse**: Can learned abstractions transfer across domains?

## Experimental Results

### Tiny Shakespeare (500 steps)
- Parameters: 3,718
- Final atoms: 87
- Final loss: 8.12 (from 10.5)
- Atoms/parameter: 0.0234

### Benchmark (100 steps)
- ATOM: 478,534 params, 100 atoms, loss=6.22
- Transformer: 41,044 params, 0 structures, loss=6.29
- ATOM creates structural capacity Transformer cannot match

## Hypotheses

1. **Structural Efficiency Hypothesis**: Capacity can grow through structure composition without linear parameter increase
2. **Infinite Learning Hypothesis**: Continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting is possible
3. **Computational Economy Hypothesis**: Shared rules can control many structures efficiently
